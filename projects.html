               <p>
                  During my undergraduate studies, I completed a number of projects and participated in several hackathons. 
                  I have experience using Django and Spring Boot for backend development and prefer React for front-end design. 
                  For relational databases, I work with Oracle DB and PostgreSQL. In my deep learning projects, I utilize PyTorch.

      <ol>
         <li>
            <b>CNN From Scratch</b><br>
            <i>Libraries: opencv, matplotlib, tqdm, numpy, pandas, pickle, scipy</i><br>
            <i>Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (LeNet)</i><br>
            <p><i>Description:</i> I developed this CNN-LeNet architecture from scratch (Using a very restricted number of libraries).
               I used opencv to read files, matplotlib for data visualization, numpy and pandas for data manipulation,
               and scipy for performance metrics and statistics. The project does not utilize any advanced
               framework such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. Thus, I had to implement all the layers with both forward and backward
               propagation. I used <i>MNIST</i> dataset to measure its performance. The codes can be found
               <a href="https://github.com/SohamKhisa/CSE472-Machine-Learning-Sessional/tree/main/Offline-4-Convolutional-Neural-Network">here</a>.

            <b>Retinal Disease Classification</b><br>
            <i>Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, PyTorch</i><br>
            <i>Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Convolutional Neural Network (AlexNet)</i>
            <p><i>Descriptoin:</i> The main objective of this project is to use retinal images to recognize and classify
               various retinal illnesses, including age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. At first, we did
               some study on several research articles on the related topic and initially decided to choose the Restricted
               Boltzmann Machine as our architecture for this project. But in the end, we went with a traditional CNN-AlexNet
               architecture. Codes and further details about this project can be found in this
               <a href="https://github.com/SohamKhisa/CSE472-Machine-Learning-Sessional/tree/main/Project-Retinal-Disease-Classification">

            <b>Auc-dais</b><br>
            <i>Tools & technologies used: Spring Boot, React, Bootstrap, PostgresSQL</i><br>
            <p><i>Description:</i> This is an online auction platform that we developed in our software engineering
               course. We used the Spring Boot framework and PostgresDB to handle the back end of the
               application and utilized React and Bootstrap to implement the front end of the application. The
               front end of the project can be found on this GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ArifShariar/auc-dais-frontend">
               repository</a>. The back end is in <a href="https://github.com/ArifShariar/auc-dais-backend">here</a>.

            <b>Cricbuzz</b><br>
            <i>Tools & Technology: JavaFX, Oracle Database</i><br>
            <p><i>Description:</i> This is a Java based desktop application inspired by
               <a href="https://www.cricbuzz.com/">cricbuzz</a>. We developed this
               application for our Database Management Systems course. However, unlike the cricbuzz web
               application this is a back-end application designed for administrators. We used JavaFX to
               implement the graphical user interface of the application and OracleDB to handle the database.

            <b>Scientific-Calculator</b><br>
            <i>Tools & Technology: C, Atmel Studio, Proteus, ATmega32, Arduino</i><br>
            <p><i>Description:</i> We built this project for our undergraduate course Microprocessors,
               Microcontrollers, and Embedded Systems. As the name suggests we built a scientific calculator on
               proteus and wrote a program on Atmel Studio to do the necessary calculations. The project is
               available in <a href="https://github.com/SohamKhisa/Scientific-Calculator">Github</a>.

            <b>C-subset Compiler</b>
            <i>Tools & Technology: C, Flex, Bison</i><br>
            <p><i>Description:</i> Description: This project is on the development of a compiler that is a subset of the C
               programming language. The operations in can handle are as follows:  arithmetic operations, functions, recursion,
               print, comment, loops, variables. The compiler was built step by step, started with the implementation of a
               symbol table, then lexical analyzer, syntax and semantic analyzer, and finally intermediate code generator.
               8086 assembly language was used as the intermediate representation. Code optimization process was also included
               in the intermediate code generator step. The source code and details about how to run the project can be found
               <a href="https://github.com/SohamKhisa/CSE310-Compiler-Sessional">here</a>.
